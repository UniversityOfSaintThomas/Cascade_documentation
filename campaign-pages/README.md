# Campaign Pages :apple:

This campaign page process documents the requirements and the steps to creating a landing page.

Some embedded marketers will try to make their own page, or at least offer to make their own page. Even when we trust them to do it themselves, campaign pages should always be a development task. After we confirm the requirements of the page, we can hand it back to the requestor to add and edit content.

## Requirements :grapes:

Whether or not the requestor specifies a URL or program code, we always confirm those details with Kathy and Cassie on the Analytics team.

-   URL of the page
-   Salesforce Program/Major/Concentration
    -   ex. **AS_CS_MA|CATH**, Master of Arts in Catholic Studies

**Unless there's a special request for additional fields, most campaign pages use these five fields.**
